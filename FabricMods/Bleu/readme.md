[Axolotl](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Axolotl)'s Blue Variant cannot be inherited! In vanilla, there's a 1-in-1200 (configurable) chance that an axolotl will be blue, this is now the only way they will be blue!

When both parents are blue, the baby may be a random non-blue color.
When either parent is non-blue, their variant may take priority.
When neither parents are is blue, their baby may be one their colors, uniformly randomly (50/50).

It will likely take many attempts to get blue axolotls now.
