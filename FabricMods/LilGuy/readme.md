Named baby animals will never grow up!
They will stay babies forever.

"Naming" a named entity with an Unnamed NameTag will Unname the entity; this can be used to allow a baby mob to grow (though, they're vulnerable to despawning).

This mod was inspired by Scotty!

A sever I played on had a feature for keeping animals as babies but it did not work.

Scotty is fine but I wanted a reliable way to have this functionality.
