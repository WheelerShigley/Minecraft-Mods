# [Diegetic](https://modrinth.com/mod/diegetic/version/0.8.0_1.21.5)

![Clocktime Example](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/6V343pDj/images/c8d5564eb088d15a4289dd9aa844cae5b2caacf2.png)

## Features
Diegetic adds several in-game means of measuring information that is otherwise only reasonably obtainable outside of the game and with "meta-gaming". The current systems added are:
   - [Clock](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Clock): shows time (configurably IRL time)
   - [Compass](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Compass): shows coordinates
   - [Recovery Compass](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Recovery_Compass): shows relative coordinates
   - [Slimeball](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Slimeball): shows if you're in a [slime-chunk](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Slime#Slime_chunks)

The tools used to measure information may be subject to change.

To reload your configurations, run "/diegetic reload" (requires op).
