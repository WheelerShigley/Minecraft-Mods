Enchantments have been *unrestricted*, they now may go to their maximum **effective** level. This can be accomplished with an anvil.
See below for the new maximum levels.

This mod is in its alpha.
There may be some bugs, let me know and I can fix them.

Known bugs:
```
Pumpkins are not enchantable.
```

Since it's largely untested, this server will server as a closed alpha.
I have tested it, personally, to be sure it *should* work and I believe I caught all cases but it is possible that I missed something.
